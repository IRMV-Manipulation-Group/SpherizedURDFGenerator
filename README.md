# SpherizedURDFGenerator
An automatic C++ only tool for generating spherized / convex version of collision geometry and write URDF automatically. 

# Introduction

## Spherized

Specifically, the term `Spherized` refers to sphere tree approximated collision.

Notice: the following steps are adopted to generate a spherized version

1. Watertight check (if not watertight, one will be generated)
2. Simplify (Optional; using `igl:decimate` to down-sample surfaces into 30%)
3. Spherized Version Generation(Several hyper-parameters can be tuned. See `config/sphereTree/sphereTreeConfig.yml`)

## Convex

Specifically, the term `Convex` refers to convex hull approximated collision.

Notice: `cgal::convex_hull()` are used.

## URDF

We only accept `stl` & `obj` file for raw collision meshes; All generated meshes are stored in `obj` file. 

All elements and formats are followed. The generated URDF file will **only** modify the collision element. For `Spherized` version, several or only one sphere are added; For `Convex` version, the collision mesh will be generated, stored and correctly referred. 

We **only** accept  and generate URDF as `.urdf`. If a `.xacro` is utilized, please refer to some other tools like (`pip install xacro`)

`python -m xacro your_file.urdf.xacro -o output_file.urdf`

# Dependencies

This package relies on binary-distributed libraries:

- [cgal](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal?tab=License-1-ov-file)
- [urdfdom](https://github.com/ros/urdfdom)
- [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)
- [tinyxml2](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2)

Fortunately, they can be installed through simple `apt-get` process.  

```shell
sudo apt-get install libcgal-dev liburdfdom-dev libyaml-cpp-dev libtinyxml2-dev libgmp-dev
```

The distribution also contains the following sources from other people (some are introduced in a header-only manner):

- [libigl](https://github.com/libigl/libigl)
- [plog](https://github.com/SergiusTheBest/plog)
- [sphere_tree](https://github.com/mlund/spheretree)
- [ManifoldPlus](https://github.com/hjwdzh/ManifoldPlus)
- [cmake-template](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/cmake_template/tree/main)

This work is built on the basis of those fantastic works. We thank all the aforementioned open-source project for the help of the implementations.

# Compile

```shell
cmake -B build . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build 
```

# Usage

## Spherized

```shell
cd build && ./spherized -i <input_urdf_path> -o <output_urdf_path> [-r <key> <value> ...] [--single_sphere <0|1>] [--simplify <0|1>]
```

- `-i <input_urdf_path>`: Specifies the path to the input URDF file.

- `-o <output_urdf_path>`: Specifies the path to the output URDF file.

- `-r <key> <value>`: Specifies replacement pairs. You can use multiple `-r` options to define several key-value pairs that will be replaced in the URDF file.   

  ​	**An useful replacement pair for ROS is “package:/” “/home/xxx/xxx_ws/src”. ** This will help this program to replace the original “package://yyy/mesh/zzz.stl” into “/home/xxx/xxx_ws/src/yyy/mesh/zzz.stl” to correctly find the mesh file without ROS. Meanwhile, the generated URDF will generate the mesh URL using the original format like “package:/yyy/mesh/zzz.obj”. So it can be directly valid for ROS

- `--single_sphere <0|1>`: Indicates whether to generate a single sphere approximation of the URDF. Use `1` to enable and `0` to disable.

- `--simplify <0|1>`: Indicates whether to simplify the URDF generation process. Use `1` to enable and `0` to disable.

## Convex

```shell
cd build && ./convex -i <input_urdf_path> -o <output_urdf_path> [-r <key> <value> ...] [--single_sphere <0|1>] [--simplify <0|1>]
```

- `-i <input_urdf_path>`: Specifies the path to the input URDF file.

- `-o <output_urdf_path>`: Specifies the path to the output URDF file.

- `-r <key> <value>`: Specifies replacement pairs. You can use multiple `-r` options to define several key-value pairs that will be replaced in the URDF file.   

  ​	**An useful replacement pair for ROS is “package:/” “/home/xxx/xxx_ws/src”. ** This will help this program to replace the original “package://yyy/mesh/zzz.stl” into “/home/xxx/xxx_ws/src/yyy/mesh/zzz.stl” to correctly find the mesh file without ROS. Meanwhile, the generated URDF will generate the mesh URL using the original format like “package:/yyy/mesh/zzz.obj”. So it can be directly valid for ROS.
